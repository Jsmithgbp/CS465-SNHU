Architecture:

In our full stack project, we used both server-side and client-side development approaches. Express HTML and JavaScript were used to develop the server-side of the application, while a single-page application (SPA) was used for the client-side development. The Express framework was used for creating APIs and handling server-side logic, while the SPA was responsible for rendering views on the client-side.

We used a NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend due to its flexible data structure and ease of scalability. NoSQL databases are known for their ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, making them an excellent choice for handling complex data types in our application.

Functionality:

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is used to transfer data between the frontend and backend of a web application. JSON is derived from JavaScript, but it is language-independent, making it easy to use with various programming languages. JSON provides an easy-to-understand data structure that is easy to parse and manipulate on both the client-side and server-side of the application.

Throughout the development process, we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies. We used reusable UI components to reduce the amount of code required to build the application, which allowed us to create a more streamlined and maintainable codebase. Reusable UI components also helped to ensure consistency throughout the application, providing a better user experience.

Testing:

Testing full stack applications can be challenging due to the various layers involved. In our application, we used different testing methods to ensure the API endpoints were working correctly. We tested GET and POST methods for each endpoint, ensuring that the application could handle different types of data. We also tested the application with various security layers, including authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users could access certain parts of the application.

Reflection:

This course has been instrumental in helping me achieve my professional goals by providing me with the skills necessary to develop full-stack web applications. I have learned how to use various technologies and frameworks such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React to build scalable and efficient web applications. I have also learned how to write clean and maintainable code, which is crucial in a professional setting. These skills have made me a more marketable candidate in my field by allowing me to take on more complex projects and deliver high-quality work.
